## Piiano Vault: The secure home for sensitive personal data

*Safely store sensitive personal data in your own cloud environment with automated compliance controls.*

# Vault-python

This repository contains SDKs for [Piiano Vault](https://piiano.com/). The first SDK included is for Django-ORM, allowing to easily and transparently encrypt data in your app's DB. 

The repository also contains examples for the included SDKs.

Upcoming SDKs:
* Automatically generated SDK for Piiano Vault's API via OpenAPI.
* Integrations with other popular Python ORMs, e.g. SQLAlchemy.

## Background

Piiano Vault is the secure home for sensitive personal data. It allows you to safely store sensitive personal data in your own cloud environment with automated compliance controls.  

Vault is deployed within your own architecture, next to other DBs used by the applications, and should be used to store the most critical sensitive personal data, such as credit cards and bank account numbers, names, emails, national IDs (e.g. SSN), phone numbers, etc.

The main benefits are:  

- Field level encryption, including key rotation.
- Searchability is allowed over the encrypted data.
- Full audit log for all data accesses.
- Granular access controls.
- Easy masking and tokenization of data.
- Out of the box privacy compliance functionality.
